How to play:
1. One of the players must launch the server.py file, and enter his address and a port to use.
2. Both players must then cd to the folder’s location, and launch the main.py file. 
3. Select whether music and sounds should play (0 or 1, yes or no and true or false are valid answers). Note: A non-valid answer will default the choice to no sound/music.
4. Both players must enter the server address, which was set in step 1.
5. Once both players are connected, the game should start. Have fun !

At the end of each game, the app must be closed and each player must go through steps 3 through 5 again. As long as the server isn’t stopped, step 1 isn’t required.
